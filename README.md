### Summary
The impending retirement of Baby Boomers, referred to as the [Silver Tsunami]([url](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarazeffgeber/2020/11/28/the-new-silver-tsunami/?sh=1a0e0cb96d69)), will have a major impact on the workforce as companies will have to compete to fill a large amount of positions at one time. One strategy that a company can take is to get ahead of the issue and identify which employees are retiring. Pewlett Hackard completed this analysis to determine if they were one of the companies that would be affected. Of the almost 300,024 employees at Pewlett Hackard, 72,458 employyes are retiring (24.1%). Losing alomost a quarter of their employees will have a significant impact on Pewlett Hackard.
Unfortuantely for Pewlett Hackard, there are only 1,940 employees that are eligible for the membership program. Having this few mentors available to assist in the training of such a large amount of new hires will place a heavy burden on the training team, especially since only half of the mentorship eligilbe employees have senior positions. The best scnearios for Pewlett Hackard are to have a staggered retirement and/or hire people with considerable experience who are not in the retirement age window.
